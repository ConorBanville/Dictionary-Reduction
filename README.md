# Dictionary Reduction 
This is a console application that takes in a txt file, psudo-randomly picking lines from that file then returning a new file with just the selected lines present.
To customise the fraction of lines taken you must change the "one_out_of" integer variable int the Program.Main method.
For example, if the inputed file has 10,000 lines and you want to take 1/10th of those lines, update the the variable to 10. This will create a new file with roughly 1000 lines present.
